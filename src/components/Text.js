         Cities and towns are wonderful places to live and by and large filled with nature – if we take the time to explore.

        <h3>Our natural habitat</h3>
        <p>
        
         Growing up in the modern developed world we can easily come to believe
          that towns and cities – the urban and artificial environment – is
          where we naturally belong. But our brains and bodies, which evolved
          over thousands of years, were designed by and designed for an
          environment very different to the one we live in now:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>throughout our evolutionary history we lived in very close connection to the land</li>
          <li> our physiological system evolved to survive in wild, natural environments</li>
          <li> we developed a love and kinship for these places that lives on in our DNA
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This connection with the land combined with the kinship we would have felt with other living things that shared the land as their home has hardwired in us a strong sense of the natural world as ‘home’, and the importance of connection with all of life as being essential to our well-being.</p>

        <p>Science is now backing up what most of us who have spent any amount of time in the outdoors intuitively know: Nature is good for us. Spending time in nature has been shown to decrease stress, alleviate depression and anxiety, improve memory, creativity, and cognitive functioning, as well as increase energy levels, boost immunity, and decrease inflammation.</p>
